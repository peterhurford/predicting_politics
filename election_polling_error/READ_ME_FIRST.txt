This data was collected by @StAscetic from Real Clear Politics and PollingReport.com

Unlike RCP, FULL NAMES ARE USED FOR POLLSTERS. For example, TIPP's actual name is
TechnoMetric  Institute of Policy Politics.  If you have question about specific pollster
names please do not hesitate to ask. 

Presidential polls are covered for the years 2000-2016
Generic Ballot polls are covered for the years 2000-2018
Governor and Senate polls are covered for the years 2002-2018
House polls are covered for the years 2004-2018

The data is provided split between either pollster or sponsor.
MAAPE is used to calculate the mean arctangent percentage error between the poll forecast and the actual outcome.

These are two different categorical types. 

For example, Fox News is a poll sponsor, while Anderson Robbins Research & Shaw Company Research has been 
their pollster of record since 2012.

Fox News, however, has used different pollsters (Pulse Opinion Research & Rasmussen, Opinion Dynamics, and Rasmussen).
In 2020 Anderson Robbins Research changed its name to Beacon Research, so officially 
Fox New's pollster of record is now Beacon Research & Shaw Company Research.

There are four main folders:

1.  all_years_all_election_types_combined
2.  by_year_all_election_types_combined
3.  by_election_types_all_year_combined
4.  by_election_type_by_year


all_years_all_election_types_combined - These are the broadest error reporting files.
They report the mean MAAPE of all election types over all available years in my database per pollster.

by_year_all_election_types_combined - These files report the mean MAAPE by year, per pollster
without regard to election type (i.e., election types are ignored and mean is rolled by year and pollster).
Here you can gage how accurate pollsters are predicting year to year.

by_election_types_all_year_combined _ This is the opposite of above.  Mean MAAPE is reported 
by election_type, per pollster without regard to election year (i.e., election years are ignored
and mean is rolled by election type and pollster).  Here you can see how accurate pollsters are 
predicting a specific election type.

by_election_type_by_year - These files report mean MAAPE per yer, per election type, per pollster.
With these files you can gage how accurate each pollster is by both election type and year.
